# DEEP LEARNING AND REMOTE SENSING

During this summer I will be exploring some functionalities of this topic. I look forward to finding it useful for object detection using satelite imagery; specifically sentinel 2 images.

With Google to a click away is becoming easier every day to catch new bunch of ideas coming from machine learning applications. For me, applying deep learning may be still a blurred topic, thus understanding what's going on under the hood of this algorithm can be essential to later on feeling more comfortable with one of the powerful frameworks in deep learning such as TensorFlow or Keras.

Well, let's start with a shallow neural network here [here](https://wamartinez.github.io/deeplearning/tutorials/shallow_neural_network.html)
